  PS2FTP Readme
			   Simple single threaded FTP server for the IOP.
			   

PS2FTP is loosely based on SimpleFTP from http://www.erc.msstate.edu/~lush/
fl1999/cs4733/assignments/simpleftp.html and makes use of an snprintf 
implementation from http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/

The goal of PS2FTP is to allow users to upload and download data such as 
save games and programs to and from memory cards on the Playstation 2
gaming console.

NOTES: In current state, src is very unorganised but it works. This will be 
       fixed soon.
       This is runnable under ps2link by increasing the max socket values in
       ps2ip\iop\ps2ip\include\lwipopts.h and then recompiling ps2ip and 
       ps2ftp. Variables changed:
       		MEMP_NUM_SYS_TIMEOUT to 5
       		MEMP_NUM_NETBUF to 8
       		MEMP_NUM_NETCONN to 8
       So far, untested under naplink.
       *WILL NOT* work under pukklink and never will (due to network stack).
