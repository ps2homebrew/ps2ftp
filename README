  PS2FTP Readme
			   Simple single threaded FTP server for the IOP.
			   

PS2FTP is loosely based on SimpleFTP from http://www.erc.msstate.edu/~lush/
fl1999/cs4733/assignments/simpleftp.html and makes use of an snprintf 
implementation from http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/

NOTE: for now you may have to the old version of SMAP, i can't seem to ping the
      ps2 when using the new smap (suggestions?)

Pre-requisites for compilation:
	PS2LIB
	PS2DRV (ps2dev9 and iomanx)
	PS2ETH (adresd's smap)
	PS2IP (requires LWIP)
	sbv-1.0-lite
	AIO (currently included; requires libcdvd & libhdd)
	
The goal of PS2FTP is to allow users to upload and download data such as 
save games and programs to and from memory cards and the HDD on the 
Playstation 2 gaming console.

NOTES: In current state, src is more organised than before and it works.
       PS2FTP now includes all needed modules in the .elf itself and loads
       them from EE memory after rebooting the IOP, therefore it should 
       work anyway you load it.
