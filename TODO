  TODO as of 10/20/2003:
  	- Find out what to do regarding PS2DRV DEV9 drivers & SMAP
  	
  	With respect to processCommand:
  	//NOTICE: THIS AREA IS SCREWING UP, there is some kind of stack
			//        weirdness or something going on, any help is appreciated
			//        please only compile with -O0 right now, it seems to give
			//        the best results. Basically, the socket is being created
			//        and its reported that its connected to the client but it
			//        never actually does, check it with a packet sniffer. If
			//        you want to help with code please concentrate _only_ on
			//        helping figure out what's going on and getting dir listing
			//        to work. CWD and other commands depend on FSMan which I
			//        have not finished writing (I wanted to haev this working
			//        to test it with.
